# Train Schedule (LIRR)

Testing capabilities of using firebase as an external database to read/write so that Web App can pull from a db and maintain the most recent state/data as opposed to starting from scratch everytime

## Getting Started

This is just a simple Web App in which you can download and open the "index.html" file.  The IDE used for this was VS Code.

## Using the Web App

On load of the page it will automatically pull a snapshot of the data from Firebase.  To add a new train schedule fill in the appropriate from data and click Submit.  This will now be in the Firebase database and display on the screen

## Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jquery
* firebase
* bootstrap
* moment.js
* magnific-popup.js

## Contributing
